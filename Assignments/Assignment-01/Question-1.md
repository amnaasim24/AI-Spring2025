# Q1

## a) Which objections still carry some weight?

1) Mathematical Objection: Turing responds to the mathematical objection, from GÃ¶del's incompleteness theorem. The objection is that there are certain truths that human beings can accept but machines cannot due to the limitation imposed by the formal systems. Turing responds to this by suggesting that there would not be any single mind that would be able to solve all the problems, but machines could be better than human intellect in many directions.

2) Lady Lovelace's Objection: Turing defines Lady Lovelace's objection as stating that machines can only be programmed to do what they are told and are not capable of displaying true originality. Turing refutes this by suggesting machines could be programmed to be able to learn from experience which would lead to unforeseen or new behavior.

## b) Are the refutations cogent?

1) Mathematical Objection: Turing's answer to the mathematical objection is pragmatic. Turing concedes that machines will never solve all problems by but they can do better than human beings in many areas. This argument is still valid today, as AI systems have been shown to possess outstanding abilities in many domains.

2) Lady Lovelace's Objection: Lady Lovelace had objected to machines being able to learn and come up with their own unexpected action. Although present-day AI computers can learn based on data input, they themselves do not have goals or want things like people do, calling into question originality's nature and whether one needs intent for it.

## c) Since he wrote the paper, can you think of new objections arising from developments?

1) Artificial intelligence using computers is increasingly able to replace traditional human labor, raising the issue of losing jobs and income disparities.

2) AI systems may be subject to hacking, adversarial attacks, and misuse.
For instance, AI systems can be used to generate fake outputs or be used nefariously for procedures such as deepfakes or autonomous cyber attacks.

3) With more and more AI integrated into everyday life, there is a massive risk that human beings will be too reliant on them and lose skills, creativity or autonomy.

## d) In the paper, he predicts that by the year 2000, a computer will have a 30% chance of passing a five-minute Turing Test with an unskilled interrogator. Do you think this is reasonable?

Turing had predicted that a machine would pass a Turing test successfully in the year 2000. But passing a Turing test was under-estimated. Now, the potential of machines has evolved very rapidly. Now, there is a high likelihood of a machine passing Turing's Test.
