# Q4

## Statement 1: An agent that senses only partial information about the state cannot be perfectly rational.

**True**
Perfect rationality demands that an individual or system should make the best choices by having all the information there is regarding the environment. An autonomous vehicle that cannot sense pedestrians, for instance, cannot make perfectly rational choices on stopping and turning.

## Statement 2: There exist task environments in which no pure reflex agent can behave rationally.

**False**
A reflex agent decides only based on what it perceives at the time, not based on any previous experience. For instance, an agent loses a game of chess since it has to consider a sequence of moves and anticipate what the other will play.

## Statement 3: There exists a task environment in which every agent is rational.

**Correct**
In a situation in which all choices yield the same outcome, all agents will choose prudently. For instance, a situation in which the agent must push a single button in order to obtain a reward.

## Statement 4: The input to an agent program is the same as the input to the agent function.

**False
The agent function takes a sequence of observations and maps them to actions, and the agent program accomplishes this function using some methods.

## Statement 5: Every agent function is implementable by some program/machine combination.

**False**

There are agents that would require infinite memory as computer resources, making them difficult to implement on real machines.

## Statement 6: Suppose an agent selects its action uniformly at random from the set of possible actions. There exists a deterministic task environment in which this agent is rational.

**True**

An agent that picks actions at random in an unchanging world will be rational because all the actions will yield the same result. For example, if you have 100 buttons in an environment, pressing all of them will have the same reward. 

## Statement 7: It is possible for a given agent to be perfectly rational in two distinct task environments.

**True** 

An agent can be perfectly rational in a number of environments. For example, an autonomous car that travels in different cities with different configurations.
